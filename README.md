-   **Per-Site Control:** Easily enable or disable the extension for specific websites.
-   **Theme Support:** Switch between light, dark, and system themes for a comfortable experience.
-   **Fuzzy Search:** Quickly find the macro you need in the popup search.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm

### Development

For the best development experience with live reloading for the extension, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the development servers:**
    This command starts both the Vite HMR server and a custom live-reload server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev:full
    ```

3.  **Load the extension in your browser:**
    -   Open Chrome/Brave and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    -   Enable "Developer mode".
    -   Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder from this project.

The extension will now automatically reload when you make changes to the source code.

### Production Build

To create an optimized production build of the extension, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the final files in the `dist` directory, ready for packaging or loading into the browser.

##  NPM Scripts

-   `npm run dev:full`: Starts the development server with live reload.
-   `npm run dev:stop`: Stops all development servers gracefully.
-   `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build in the `dist/` folder.
-   `npm run test`: Runs the full test suite using Vitest.
-   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
-   `npm run format`: Formats all files using Prettier.
